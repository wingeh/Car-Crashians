# Project Description 

As a safe driver in the city of Ottawa and as a lover of all things pop culture I want to be able to measure the safety of my planned routes and to display this information in a fun way. 

1. On load users are presented with a search Icon and a blank map.

2. When the search Icon is pressed a menu appears. The menu takes two locations and maps out a route when the search button is pressed.

3. If the about me button is pressed you are taken to an about me page.

4. When the search button is pressed a route is displayed on the map.

5. Underneath the map are turn by turn directions and the route ranting.

# Calculations

1. In order to know how safe a drive is this app will compare the coordinate points generated by the Mapbox API with the coordinate points provided by the city of Ottawwa's crash data API. THe length of the array of matching coordinate points is what determines a routes rating. 

2. If there are less than two matches, the route is ranked as a Rob Kardashian, 2 but less than 4 is a Kourtney, 4 but less than 6 is a Khloe, and everything above 6 is a Kim. 

**How often will you have meetings? How long?**
Thursday – 6:00pm

**How will you keep track of tasks?** 
That software of not started/in progress/complete

**What if someone misses a deadline?** 
We build in leeway for there to account for incomplete portions. Ambitious deadlines.

**What happens if someone misses a meeting?  What is their responsibility? The team’s responsibility?**
We provide notes after the meeting, and if a person misses the meeting, a written report can be submitted to the group to keep everyone updated. Minutes will be posted in the slack.

**How does each team member like to receive feedback?**
For myself, directly and collaboratively.

**What if there is friction between members?  How will you address it?** 
Depending on the nature of it, head on. Get the hard part out of the way, then tackle to problem together outside of what it represents internally to the people involved. Us against the issue.
